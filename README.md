# Healthcare Diabetes Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that predicts diabetes risk based on healthcare data. By analyzing patient health metrics, the model assists in identifying individuals at higher risk of diabetes, helping healthcare providers make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

The `Healthcare_Diabeties_Prediction.ipynb` notebook is designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning. This analysis aids in early intervention strategies, promoting proactive healthcare and effective resource allocation.

### Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze and visualize healthcare data to understand factors contributing to diabetes risk.
- **Feature Engineering**: Process patient data for modeling, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
- **Diabetes Prediction Model**: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares healthcare data, addressing missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the distribution of key health metrics and their correlation with diabetes risk.
- **Modeling**: Implements machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to predict diabetes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to ensure reliable predictions.
